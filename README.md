## Exploratory Data Analysis on a supply chain Dataset.

Explored each Variables to gain insight and also correlation among them.
Key insights found:
>> 1. Top 99th Percentile of source centre sends Bulk of total orders.
>> 2. Top 95th Percentile of Destination centres recieves Bulk of total Orders.
>> 3. Using Hexbin and Contour Graphs it is seen that Order Starting at Certain Hours of the Day may be Delayed.
>> 4. Difference in Actual Time and Estimated time .
>> 5. Supply Chain Network Graph; it shows how Custers of centres are inter linked with back and forth order and some centers which only recieve orders.
>> 6. correlation Graph showing relation among different numeric Variables.
